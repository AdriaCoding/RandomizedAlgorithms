# Adrià's Randomized Algorithms repository

This is a repository of all my codes for the course in Randomized Algorithms at my master's degree, check out the course's open source [webpage](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~conrado/docencia/ra-miri.html).

To install Julia, you can go the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the appropriate steps for your system. 

If you have added Julia to PATH, you can start a new session into the Julia REPL by just running "julia" (or else, run "/path/to/julia/bin/julia)" on your favorite command interface.

Feel free to play arround with the REPL to be more familiarized with the language. I encourage checking out the [offical documentation manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/), and this [cool tutorial](https://youtu.be/EkgCENBFrAY?si=DTJ3SP1Shm0wYKTk) by Miguel Raz.

## Assignment 1 
First assignment is about calculating π using the classic "throwing-darts" and "Buffon needles" Monte Carlo algorithms. See *assignment-1.pdf* for further details about the assignment.

To try my code you just need to clone the repository and start a Julia REPL session from there. You can check your current working directory via the ```pwd()``` function and change it via ```cd("/path/to/RandomizedAlgorithms")```.
